# Song-Library
A program that allows users to manage and organize songs

Both SongApp and Song were written by me, SongDriver was provided by my professor to run and test both implementations of the song library project.

When testing, compile all 3 java programs, and run SongDriver in order to go through the methods and see what they do and how they work.
