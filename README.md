# Song-Library
A program that allows users to manage and organize songs

Both SongApp and Song were written by me, SongDriver was not written by me, but provided by my professor as part of the project for the class.

The IO class functions similarly to Scanners in java, and it is important to note that I did not write the the file myself.

When testing, compile all 4 java programs, then run SongDriver.
